## 📦 Deployment
### Deploying the Frontend
1. Use **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or any static hosting service for the `index.html` file.
2. Simply drag and drop your `index.html` and associated files into the hosting platform.

### Deploying the Backend
Choose a hosting service that supports WebSocket, such as:
- **Render**
- **Heroku**
- **Railway**

1. Deploy your `server.js` file to the backend platform.
2. Update the WebSocket URL in the frontend to point to the deployed server (e.g., `wss://your-app-name.herokuapp.com`).
